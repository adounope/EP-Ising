Ising model trained by Equilibrium Propagatoin algorithm
to perform image recognition / reconstruction on MNIST dataset

Python3.9.21

prepare train data by runnnig all code in dataset.ipynb

run main.py to train forward only model

run main_bi.py to bi-directionally train model
  to modify scale of both (effective learning rate and the initial interaction strength) between input-hidden layer, modify line 26
    topology[  : i_s , i_s : i_s + h_s ] = topology.T[  : i_s , i_s : i_s + h_s ] = 1/5

run ep_reverse_Gen_test.ipynb to generate reconstructed image from bi-directionally trained model
